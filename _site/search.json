    "text": "Dr.¬†Ajay Kumar Koli, PhD | Founder and Executive Director | \n\n‚ÄúCultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence.‚Äù - Babasaheb Dr.¬†B. R. Ambedkar\n\nI am a first-generation Ph.D.¬†scholar hailing from a Scheduled Caste (SC) background in India. With great pride, I introduce the Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science (SaRa Institute), a project close to my heart aimed at bringing data science education to the underrepresented segments of India. My teaching toolkit comprises R and RStudio, enabling me to make data science education an accessible and engaging experience.\nEducation, to me, is the beacon that awakens individuals, fostering a profound sense of agency and a determination to confront the injustices that persist in our society. In my roles as an educator, I impart this sense of awakening to my students, encouraging them to advocate for a dignified existence. I teach Research Methodology (RM) and Data Science (DS) with a passion that empowers my students to apply their classroom knowledge to decipher both the everyday challenges and complex global issues like climate change, casteism, and racism.\nTeaching, for me, is a journey of pure joy, mutual learning, and spirited debate. I craft my lectures to ignite the same enthusiasm in my students, transforming the process of acquiring new knowledge into an exciting adventure. Prior to delving into a new topic, I seek swift feedback from my students about previous lectures. I also recap prior lessons and provide an overview of the current lecture‚Äôs place within the course, helping students prepare for what lies ahead.\nRecognizing that some students may initially hesitate to participate in classroom discussions, I offer them the time and space to build a connection with the course material. I warmly invite them to reach out via email or during office hours, valuing the importance of education, classroom inclusivity, and respectful professional relationships. I remain committed to ensuring that no student faces discrimination, be it direct or indirect, based on their gender, color, religion, or caste. As each lecture concludes, I take it upon myself to ensure that the students leave with both a sense of accomplishment and anticipation, sporting smiles in eager anticipation of our next enriching session."
