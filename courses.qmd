# Admission to the Courses

We give admission to only thirty students. Any graduate student can apply to SARA Institute. We teach:

- R programming to clean, visualize, model, and communicate the data.

- Research methods to improve data analysis skills and develop critical research perspectives.

- Statistics focus on the interpretation of the statistical results.

- Data ethics to develop a broad perspective towards the pro and cons of Artificial Intelligence.

- English language writing, reading, and speaking skills.

It will take at least one year to finish all the above courses. All classes are in-person, so you must attend classes Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm at the SARA Institute. There will be NO online classes. We do not promise any job. But we will give our best support to students to land their first data science job.

# List of the Courses
## 1. R For Beginners

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/cover.jpg){width="25%"}

I began my data science journey with R language. To know more about my journey as a data science teacher please visit the website of my course ["R for Beginners"](https://r4b.netlify.app/). 
R is programming language. [R project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) website defines it as "a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics". R is very famous for its accurate statistical analysis and elegant graphics. It is equally powerful for developing Shiny apps.

We will be following the online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Each chapter will be covered including the exercises. Using this book we will be covering data science framework, data Visualization, data cleaning, quarto for making slides, websites, thesis, and reports.

## 2. Basics of Statistics

Learning statistics is one of the most important part of data science. We will be "discovering" statistics using the book from one of the most respected researchers in the field, [PROF. ANDY FIELD & HIS CAT PROF. MILTON ðŸ˜º](https://www.discoveringstatistics.com/)

Using this book we will be exploring the following topics:

Why you need science; reporting research, variables and measurement; summarizing data; fitting models (central tendency); presenting data; z-scores; probability; inferential statistics; robust estimation; hypothesis testing; modern approaches to theory testing; assumptions; relationships (correlation); the general linear model; comparing two means; comparing several means; factorial designs.

## 3. Research Methods

Academics or industry this course will be extremely helpful for you to evolve critical research thinking. We will be following three books:

Codes execute what you think; however what you think depends on how you view a specific issue. Research methodology helps us think critically about problems and questions; it teaches us how to find earlier or other possible solutions in an ocean of information. It also trains us how to use scientific methods to do analysis and reporting of the results without biases and following the ethics.
