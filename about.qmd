*Jai Bhim!! Namo Buddhay!!*

SaRa is a non-governmental and nonprofit organisation consisting of the Institute of data science, its divisions, departments and faculties.

On 05 April 2023, SaRa Institute was founded by [Dr. Ajay Koli](https://koliajay.netlify.app/) and Dr. Kiran Koli. We are inspired by Dalit, Adivasi, and Bahujan leaders of social democracy and justice. SaRa Institute of Data Science is a tribute to Savitribai Phule and Rambai Ambedkar. SaRa is formed as “SA” taken from Savitrimai and “RA” from Ramai.

SaRa Institute provides free education to each and every student. Most of our students are first generation learners who come from non-English medium humble rural backgrounds. We teach students almost for a year which help them:

- to get their first data science job,
- to avail scholarship for higher education,
- to get admission in under-graduate or postgraduate data science courses in reputed institutions.   

We conduct research projects to give hands-on data training to our students. We are in the process, more information soon.

We meet our expenses from the donations received from community members. We are sincerely thankful to our donors. Soon, we will also share about our future goals and plans.

I am a first-generation Ph.D. scholar hailing from a Scheduled Caste (SC) background in India. With great pride, I introduce the Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science (SaRa Institute), a project close to my heart aimed at bringing data science education to the underrepresented segments of India. My teaching toolkit comprises R and RStudio, enabling me to make data science education an accessible and engaging experience.

Education, to me, is the beacon that awakens individuals, fostering a profound sense of agency and a determination to confront the injustices that persist in our society. In my roles as an educator, I impart this sense of awakening to my students, encouraging them to advocate for a dignified existence. I teach Research Methodology (RM) and Data Science (DS) with a passion that empowers my students to apply their classroom knowledge to decipher both the everyday challenges and complex global issues like climate change, casteism, and racism.

Teaching, for me, is a journey of pure joy, mutual learning, and spirited debate. I craft my lectures to ignite the same enthusiasm in my students, transforming the process of acquiring new knowledge into an exciting adventure. Prior to delving into a new topic, I seek swift feedback from my students about previous lectures. I also recap prior lessons and provide an overview of the current lecture's place within the course, helping students prepare for what lies ahead.

Recognizing that some students may initially hesitate to participate in classroom discussions, I offer them the time and space to build a connection with the course material. I warmly invite them to reach out via email or during office hours, valuing the importance of education, classroom inclusivity, and respectful professional relationships. I remain committed to ensuring that no student faces discrimination, be it direct or indirect, based on their gender, color, religion, or caste. As each lecture concludes, I take it upon myself to ensure that the students leave with both a sense of accomplishment and anticipation, sporting smiles in eager anticipation of our next enriching session.

I am Dr. Kiran Lata Koli, and I am proud to introduce SaRa Institute of Data Science, our heartfelt initiative to empower underrepresented students across India. My academic journey includes a PhD in Dairy Chemistry from the prestigious Indian Council of Agricultural Research - National Dairy Research Institute, located in Karnal, Haryana. Furthermore, I hold an M.Sc. in Food Technology from Guru Jambheshwar University of Science & Technology, Hisar, Haryana. My dedication to knowledge is evident in my qualification for the ASRB – NET in Food Technology.

With over three years of teaching experience at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels, I have had the privilege of educating students in various aspects of Food Technology across different universities. Additionally, I have played a pivotal role in guiding and supervising numerous undergraduate and postgraduate students through their major dissertation projects.

My journey in academia extends to two years of invaluable research experience at the National Dairy Research Institute in Karnal, Haryana. During this time, I have made significant contributions to peer-reviewed journals with publications that have been recognized with awards for the best research paper, best review paper, and best poster presentations.

I am driven by a profound desire to give back to society by channeling my wealth of teaching and research experience to educate and empower the aspiring minds of India.
