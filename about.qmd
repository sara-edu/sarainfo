*Jai Bhim!! Namo Buddhay!!*

On 05 April 2023, SARA Institute was founded by [Dr. Ajay Koli](https://koliajay.netlify.app/) and Dr. Kiran Koli. We are inspired by Dalit, Adivasi, and Bahujan leaders of social democracy and justice. SARA Institute of Data Science is a tribute to Savitribai Phule and Rambai Ambedkar. SARA is formed as “SA” taken from Savitrimai and “RA” from Ramai.

SARA Institute provides free education to each and every student. Most of our students are first generation learners who come from non-English medium humble rural backgrounds. We teach students almost for a year which help them:

- to get their first data science job,
- to avail scholarship for higher education,
- to get admission in under-graduate or postgraduate data science courses in reputed institutions.   

We conduct research projects to give hands-on data training to our students. We are in the process, more information soon.

We meet our expenses from the donations received from community members. We are sincerely thankful to our donors. Soon, we will also share about our future goals and plans.

<!-- SARA institute is a tribute to Savitrimai Phule and Ramamai Ambedkar. We provide free data science, research, and English language education to Dalit, Adivasi, Bahujan, and EWS students in India. -->

<!-- Every year, we aim to teach around thirty students. Our courses help students land their first data science job or avail scholarship for higher studies. -->

<!-- Data science is an extremely important field of study. Today, whether you work in industry or academics you have to interact with data and/or its outputs. In India, several institutions offer data science education but somehow most of these courses are exclusionary due to their high fees and gated communities. -->

<!-- Sara institute is a non-profit organization. It aims to offer free data science in-person education to underrepresented students (especially, SC/ST/OBC) in India. We will teach students how to do data analysis using advanced data science tools like R and Python. This will improve their prospects to get a better job or to avail scholarships for further studies. -->

<!-- Each year, we are taking a maximum of thirty students across India. These students -->
<!-- should have at least a graduate degree in any discipline and should be able to attend in-person data science courses, projects, and job training at the Sara Institute. We will facilitate students in getting accommodation and food services. But they will have to bear the room and food expenses (around five thousand rupees per month per student, 50 USD). Gradually, we will try to provide stipends to needy students. -->

<!-- Sara Institute will meet its expenses through donations initially. In the future, once we have legal permissions from the Government of India (GOI) then we will do collaborative data science and research project for national and international institutions. We seek urgent donations to meet our expenses. -->

> "Cultivation of mind should be the ultimate aim of human existence." - Babasaheb Dr. B. R. Ambedkar

I'm a first-generation Ph.D. academic from a Scheduled Caste (SC) in India. Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science (SARA Institute) is my initiative to take data science education to underrepresented students in India. I use R & RStudio to teach data science. I am sincerely trying to make teaching and learning data science less painful.

The purpose of education is to awaken the people. An awakening towards a sense of agency to agitate for a dignified life facilitates organizing against injustice. I teach Research Methodology (RM) and Data Science (DS) with the same spirit that enables my students to practice and apply their classroom learning to better understand and evaluate both the day-to-day, as well as real-world challenges like climate change, casteism, and racism.

For me, teaching is a process of sheer joy, learning, and debate. I prepare my lectures in such a way that my excitement about the topic is quickly shared by the students as well which makes learning new things less intimidating. Before starting a new topic, I prefer to take quick feedback from the students about the previous lectures. I also summarize previous topics and share with students an outline of the present lecture and where it fits in the course. This helps students to prepare themselves for the lecture ahead.

During my teaching experience, I realized some students hesitate to speak up in the classroom setting. Hence, I give them enough time to develop a connection with the course. I always welcome them to email me or meet me during office hours. I know the importance of education, classroom integrity, and respectful professional relationships. I always make sure no direct or indirect discrimination is experienced by any student due to their gender, color, religion, or caste. Before leaving the lecture hall, I ensure the satisfaction of work myself and a smile for my students who are looking forward to the next teaching session with curiosity.
