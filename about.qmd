I'm a first-generation Ph.D. academic from a Scheduled Caste (SC) in India. Savitribai Ramabai Institute of Data Science (SARA Institute) is my initiative to take data science education to underrepresented students in India. I use R & RStudio to teach data science. I am sincerely trying to make teaching and learning data science less painful.

The purpose of education is to awaken the people. An awakening towards a sense of agency to agitate for a dignified life facilitates organizing against injustice. I teach Research Methodology (RM) and Data Science (DS) with the same spirit that enables my students to practice and apply their classroom learning to better understand and evaluate both the day-to-day, as well as real-world challenges like climate change, casteism, and racism.

For me, teaching is a  process of sheer joy, learning, and debate. I prepare my lectures in such a way that my excitement about the topic is quickly shared by the students as well which makes learning new things less intimidating. Before starting a new topic, I prefer to take quick feedback from the students about the previous lectures. I also summarize previous topics and share with students an outline of the present lecture and where it fits in the course. This helps students to prepare themselves for the lecture ahead.

During my teaching experience, I realized some students hesitate to speak up in the classroom setting. Hence, I give them enough time to develop a connection with the course. I always welcome them to email me or meet me during office hours. I know the importance of education, classroom integrity, and respectful professional relationships. I always make sure no direct or indirect discrimination is experienced by any student due to their gender, color, religion, or caste. Before leaving the lecture hall, I ensure the satisfaction of work myself and a smile for my students who are looking forward to the next teaching session with curiosity.
